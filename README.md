# Blockchain-Funchain
Why not make learning blockchain basics fun?

Many people turn down the idea of this technology having any real value so if we could help explain more of what's going on within the blockchain, maybe more people could grasp this techonology.

## Gists:

### Just4Fun (aka J4F & #J4F)
  Just for fun, yes that's what we are looking for. J4F will display live data about the input as it's happening. This helps people understand things like, the machines can get numbers from letters and slowly pushes automation of a more real kind. Most people over-thing automation in applications and websites from movies and unreal expectations of such. This brings them back down to earth and some of the outputs are in example:
- Input Length
- Output Length
- Input Length (i-l) combined in different ways to the Output Length (o-l)
- Dirrivates of other outputs from the automation (essentailly showing how one automation can effect another)

### 3D Hash
   This is a custom hash generator by 3D. This shows users how some input can cuase a specific output like a secure hash generator would do. A great introduction to these types of generators and also that hashes can have data inside of it. Great for hands on learners!

### Hash Game (JS Game & Example)
   This is a custom hash generator by 3D. This shows users how some input can cuase a specific output like a secure hash generator would do but here they can see that inputs can be swapped for a predefined output, in this case making the game. This is a text-based game that requires clicking, reading and inputing data. A great introduction to generator flaws. Great for hands on learners!

### Flexseed Hash Generator
   This hash generator shows how the different data is placed into a block (physically some for extra help for visual learners). This is a user only orianted block builder and does not output a blockchain but instead just a block of data based on the user input.

### Blockcain MSGR (test field)
   Blockchain MSGR Chain is a test field to write and messages to the blockchain. This does have an open basic PHP port for broswer as server connectivity. The input for the blockchain is defined by time and user input and this does build a real blockchain type output for the user to see.
